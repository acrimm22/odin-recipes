            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 425F. Line a baking dish with 
                        parchment paper.
                        Toss together beets, onion, garlic, oil, thyme, 
                        salt, and pepper.
                        Cover with foil.
                        Roast for 40 to 45 minutes until beets are tender.
                    </li>
                    <li>While beets are roasting, cook pasta in salted water 
                        according to package directions until al dente.
                        Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining and set aside. Drain 
                        pasta and return to the pot.
                    </li>
                    <li>When beets are fork tender, transfer the roasted 
                        vegetables into a blender or food processer along 
                        with half of the reserved pasta water. Pulse until the 
                        vegetables start to break down, then increase the 
                        speed and puree until smooth.
                    </li>
                    <li>Combine the beet pasta sauce with the cooked pasta 
                        and toss well to coat. Stir in parmesan cheese 
                        and red bell pepper flakes. Add more of the reserved 
                        pasta water as needed until the pasta is evenly
                        coated and the sauce is silky, not gummy or thick.
                    </li>
                    <li>Divide the pasta between pasta bowls or plates 
                        and dot with chunks of goat cheese. Garnish with a
                        generous amount of chopped pistachios and torn basil leaves.
                        Sprinkle with additional red pepper flakes, to taste.
                    </li>
                </ol>
