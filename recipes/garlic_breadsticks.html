            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <h5>Make the Pizza Dough</h5>
                <ol>
                    <il>Gather Ingredients</il>
                    <il>In a stand mixer bowl, combine water, oil, yeast, 
                        and sugar. Mix gently and let stand 10 minutes.
                    </il>
                    <il>Using a dough hook attachment, fold in flour gradually 
                        while mixing until the dough is no longer sticky and 
                        pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Continue to knead 
                        the mixure with the dough hook for 3 to 5 minutes. If 
                        the dough is too sticky, add more flour, about 0.25 cups 
                        at a time.
                    </il>
                    <il>Drizzle the dough and the sides of the bowl with more 
                        olive oil. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let 
                        rise for 1 hour in a warm place.
                    </il>
                </ol>

                    <il>Gather the Ingredients</il>
                    <il>Preheat the oven to 425F. Rub olive oil onto a rolling 
                        pin and brush a light layer of oil onto a piece of 
                        parchment paper. Grease a baking sheet as well, or line
                        it with parchment paper.
                    </il>
                    <il>Roll the pizza dough out into a thick rectangle on 
                        the oiled parchment paper. The dough should be about 
                        0.75 to 1 inch thick, and made roughly into an
                        8 by 11 inch rectangle.
                    </il>
                    <il>Cut the dough into strips using a pizza cutter or 
                        flour scraper. You should be able to cut about 10, 1 
                        inch wide, strips.
                    </il>
                    <il>Place the strips on the prepared baking sheet. 
                        Brush the strips with olive oil.
                    </il>
                    <il>Bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until golden 
                        brown and fluffy.
                    </il>
                    <il>In a small bowl, whisk together the melted butter,
                        garlic, parsley, salt, basil, and garlic powder.
                    </il>
                    <il>While the bread sticks are still warm, brush the garlic 
                        butter on top of each breadstick.
                    </il>
                    <il>Serve immediately while warm.</il>
